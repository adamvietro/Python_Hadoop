# Python_Hadoop
This was created to work with Hadoop on a windows machine.

Make sure to install the hdfs lib with:
pip install hdfs
using the command line.

The information that I wanted to use was the Path of Exile public API stash focusing on the 
items. I sorted by ilvl and then used Map Reduce to pull the top items by ilvl.

Thanks for reading and using my code.
